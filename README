# dnsserver

Dummy, quick and dirty, DNS server I use for my dev of HAProxy's DNS runtime resolver.

# build

```
make build
```

# run

```
./dnsserver
```

# Use

Update the go source file accordingly to your needs, build it, then run it.

Simply point your HAProxy (or client) to this daemon:

```
resolvers dnsserver
  nameserver dnsserver 127.0.0.1:5300
```
